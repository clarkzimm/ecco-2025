    "# Auxiliary Tool\n",
    "When using various EMU tools described earlier, users may want to create some input files themselves—for example, by specifying model diagnostic output for the [Modified Simulation (msim) Tool](./msim.ipynb).  \n",
    "To achieve this, EMU provides an additional utility called the Auxiliary Tool. This tutorial demonstrates how to use it."
